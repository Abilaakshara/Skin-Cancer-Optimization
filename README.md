# Skin-Cancer-Optimization
Developed a CNN model achieving 86% accuracy for skin lesion classification. Optimized performance by 10% using hyperparameter tuning. Deployed a real-time prediction app with Streamlit, featuring interactive visualizations. Built with TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV to aid early detection of skin cancer.
